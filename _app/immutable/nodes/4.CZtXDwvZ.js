I knew right away that I wanted to improve my skills in it, so I challenged myself to create a kinetic typography animation. <br> Kinetic typography appealed to me because it's such a creative and effective way to bring text to life, communicate emotions, and keep the viewer's attention. I decided to animate a movie scene to make the project more personal, I chose the scene "Edge of Night" from The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, as it resonated deeply with me and matched perfectly with what I envisioned.
    
            One of the biggest challenges was deciding which techniques and effects to use in After Effects, as the program offers an overwhelming number of possibilities. On top of that, getting sick with COVID halfway through created a huge backlog and extra stress. Despite that, I managed to pick up where I left off and gradually built the animation step-by-step.
    
            This project taught me a lot, especially the importance of making decisions quickly and keeping an organized workflow. Through experimenting and watching many tutorials, I improved significantly in After Effectsâ€”from simple fade-in effects to more complex 3D transitions. In the end, I'm really happy with the result, mostly because it clearly shows how much my skills have grown.
