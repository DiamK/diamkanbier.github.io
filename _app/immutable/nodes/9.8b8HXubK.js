Puzzlewalk was created to make walking feel more like a game. Each walk becomes a mission to find hidden puzzle pieces in an augmented reality world.</p> <p class="mb-4 text-gray-200">Players walk a certain distance to collect pieces, then put them together to complete a puzzle on their screen. Finishing a puzzle earns points, which can be used to unlock rewards. The idea is to make progress feel fun and satisfying.</p> <p class="mb-4 text-gray-200">Users can also spot others nearby and walk together. That sense of community helps take the edge off the pain and makes the experience more social and supportive.</p> <p class="mb-4 text-gray-200">My role was to turn these ideas into a working prototype in Figma. I focused on keeping everything simple and easy to follow, especially for people who might not be very tech-savvy. One of the hardest parts was figuring out how to make the AR puzzle concept feel playful but still realistic.</p> <p class="mb-4 text-gray-200">This project gave me a better understanding of how to design for people who aren't always comfortable with technology.</p></section> <p class="mt-4 text-sm"><a class="text-blue-300 hover:text-blue-100" href="https://www.figma.com/proto/Pc85xF8C27UPXjczCV8vagcX/npi?node-id=1-2&amp;t=xuKuA1tEiqovuz0r-1&amp;scaling=scale-down&amp;content-scaling=fixed&amp;page-id=0%3A1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">View full prototype â†’</a></p> <section class="additional-images mt-10 mb-10"><div class="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6"><img alt="Puzzlewalk AR map view" class="rounded-lg shadow-md"> <img alt="Collecting puzzle pieces" class="rounded-lg shadow-md"> <img alt="Puzzle assembly and shop screen" class="rounded-lg shadow-md"></div></section></div>`);function k(m){var i=w(),a=s(i);e(a,"href",`${t}/`);var g=s(a);e(g,"src",`${t}/images/arrow_back.svg`),b(),o(a);var r=l(a,10),n=s(r),c=s(n);e(c,"src",`${t}/images/puzzlewalk1.png`);var p=l(c,2);e(p,"src",`${t}/images/puzzlewalk2.png`);var d=l(p,2);e(d,"src",`${t}/images/puzzlewalk3.png`),o(n),o(r),o(i),u(m,i)}export{k as component};
