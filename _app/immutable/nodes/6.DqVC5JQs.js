Our challenge was finding
        a solution that remained completely hands‑free and compliant with traffic laws.</p> <p class="mb-4 text-gray-200">To comply with mobile phone regulations, the app only works when driving under 10 km/h. We designed a simple
        interface controlled by just a few gestures recognized by the camera, making it safe and intuitive to use.</p> <p class="mb-4 text-gray-200">Inspired by the game “Finish the Lyric,” the app plays a short music clip and prompts users to sing the next
        line, adding a playful twist to an otherwise stressful situation.</p> <p class="mb-4 text-gray-200">We delivered a working Figma prototype that demonstrates the gesture controls and interface design, providing
        Daily Ops with a clear foundation for future development.</p> <p class="mt-4 text-sm"><a class="text-blue-300 hover:text-blue-100" href="https://www.figma.com/proto/KSkW6DF0pY7Pt6GC7Dy7RUlT/Finish-the-Jam?node-id=101-2&amp;p=f&amp;t=mU3GZrmbs95nswfv-1&amp;scaling=scale-down&amp;content-scaling=fixed&amp;page-id=20%3A0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">View full prototype →</a></p></section> <section class="additional-images mb-10"><div class="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6"><img alt="Finish the Jam flow 1" class="rounded-lg shadow-md"></div></section></div>`);function y(l){var s=f(),e=a(s);i(e,"href",`${r}/`);var c=a(e);i(c,"src",`${r}/images/arrow_back.svg`),g(),t(e);var o=h(e,8),n=a(o),p=a(n);i(p,"src",`${r}/images/finishjam_1.png`),t(n),t(o),t(s),d(l,s)}export{y as component};
