So I began by learning how to animate the fireball using advanced particle and smoke simulations in Blender.</p> <p class="mb-4 text-gray-200">As I progressed, I experimented with integrating the animated fireball into a live-action setting as a VFX element. However, due to the complexity and time constraints, it remains a work in progress. This project has been a valuable learning experience that sets the stage for more refined VFX work in the future.</p></section> <div class="video-container flex justify-center"><iframe title="Fireball Animation" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K67Qpnb-WWs?si=pmXT7oVDbDG_o42e" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" class="rounded-lg shadow-lg"></iframe></div></div>');function u(o){var e=d(),t=a(e);r(t,"href",`${l}/`);var n=a(t);r(n,"src",`${l}/images/arrow_back.svg`),i(),s(t),i(8),s(e),m(o,e)}export{u as component};
